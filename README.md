# MSE110
Python project for MSE110 2025 class

## Instructions
Download these files to a folder on your computer.
Create a new environment by running the following in your terminal:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
This creates a Python environment as specified by the "environment.yml" file.
Activate the environment.
```
conda activate pyproject
```
Run Jupyter Lab
```
jupyter lab
```
Jupyter Lab should open and you should be able to run the example files.

Here are some project ideas to get you started, but you are free to follow your own ideas.

### 1. Basic Materials Comparison Projects

#### Project Prompt 1.1: Oxide vs. Nitride Comparison

Create a simple script that retrieves and compares the band gaps of metal oxides versus metal nitrides (e.g., TiO2 vs TiN). Generate a basic bar chart showing these differences for 5-10 different metals.

#### Project Prompt 1.2: Element Explorer

Build a program that allows a user to select an element from the periodic table and displays all the binary compounds (with oxygen, nitrogen, etc.) containing that element. Create simple visualizations showing their band gaps and formation energies.

#### Project Prompt 1.3: Binary Phase Diagram Plotter

Extend the binary phase diagram example from your notebooks to allow students to input two different elements and generate the phase diagram. Focus on visualization rather than complex analysis.

### 2. Simple Material Filtering Tools

#### Project Prompt 2.1: Band Gap Filter

Create a program that allows users to specify a band gap range and returns a list of materials that match those criteria. Generate a simple histogram of the results.

#### Project Prompt 2.2: Semiconductor Finder

Build a tool that identifies semiconducting materials (band gap between 0.1 and 4.0 eV) for a specific chemical system (like Si-O or Zn-S). Visualize the results with basic plots.

#### Project Prompt 2.3: Density Sorter

Develop a script that ranks materials by their density and creates a simple visualization showing the lightest and heaviest materials in the database for a selected chemical system.

### 3. Simple Visualization Projects

#### Project Prompt 3.1: Property Correlation Plotter

Create a program that plots two selected properties (e.g., band gap vs. formation energy) for a specific material family and calculates the correlation coefficient.

#### Project Prompt 3.2: Material Property Dashboard

Build a simple dashboard that displays key properties (band gap, density, formation energy) for a selected material in an easy-to-read format with basic visualizations.

#### Project Prompt 3.3: Crystal System Distribution

Develop a script that visualizes the distribution of crystal systems (cubic, tetragonal, etc.) within a given material family using pie charts or bar graphs.

### 4. Educational Tools

#### Project Prompt 4.1: Element Analysis Tool

Create a program that shows how the presence of specific elements influences material properties. For example, how does adding aluminum to iron oxide change its properties?

#### Project Prompt 4.2: Periodic Trends Visualizer

Develop a tool that visualizes how material properties change across the periodic table for simple compounds (e.g., oxides of different metals).

#### Project Prompt 4.3: Structure Type Explorer

Build a program that identifies and compares common structure types (rock salt, fluorite, etc.) and their typical properties using simple visualizations.

### 5. Application-Based Projects

#### Project Prompt 5.1: Simple Solar Cell Material Finder

Create a tool that identifies materials with band gaps in the ideal range for solar cells (1.1-1.7 eV) and ranks them by stability (energy above hull).

#### Project Prompt 5.2: Basic Battery Material Explorer

Develop a program that compares properties of common battery materials (like lithium compounds) with simple visualizations of voltage, capacity, or stability.

#### Project Prompt 5.3: Transparent Materials Identifier

Build a script that finds materials with wide band gaps (>3 eV) that could be potentially transparent, focusing on simple filtering and basic visualization.
